Card game "Tichu", v January 2021

- game mechanics has been largely implemented up to some specific to dos (todos listed in main.py)
- one open question is how to add the "Dogs" to the Tichu game in the most elegant way (existing versions of the game seem to not do this properly)

big ToDo's after that:
- graphical interface
- bots
